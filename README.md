# ðŸ“„ Technical Documentation Page

This project is a **fully responsive technical documentation page** built using **HTML5** and **CSS3** as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
It demonstrates how to structure documentation-style content with an always-visible navigation bar for easy access to different sections.


## ðŸ“š Project Overview

The page contains multiple sections explaining web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and deployment.  
A fixed sidebar navigation allows users to jump to each topic instantly.  
The layout adjusts automatically for smaller screens using **CSS media queries**.

This project fulfills all **FreeCodeCamp user stories** for the Technical Documentation Page challenge.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Create a `main` element with the id `main-doc` containing the main documentation content.
- Build at least **five** `section` elements with the class `main-section`.
- Ensure each `.main-section` has:
  - A unique `id` based on its header text (spaces replaced with underscores).
  - A header element as the first child.
  - Paragraphs, code snippets, and list items for illustrative content.
- Create a `nav` element with the id `navbar` containing:
  - One header element describing the documentation.
  - Navigation links (`a.nav-link`) to each main section.
- Make the navigation fixed on the left for large screens.
- Use at least one **media query** for responsive design.
